# coding-101-basics

## Why I’m doing this
I’m building a strong foundation in coding from basics to advanced, with consistent weekly practice and real mini-projects.

## Goal
Become interview-ready, land an Associate Software Engineer role, and level up to Senior Software Engineer within ~1 year through focused learning + portfolio projects.

## Structure
- `week-1/` = fundamentals + small exercises
- `week-2/` = fundamentals + small exercises
(Expands weekly.)
